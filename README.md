# spreadsheet-prompts-dataset
A data set including 150 Turkish text prompts for spreadsheets

This data set is created for academic purposes, for researchers and developers working on spreadsheet automation.

In the data set, there are 4 columns.

The first column (A) has the Turkish prompt texts, which are written considering as many alternative ways as possible.

The second column (B) has the function's name, which must be used for that corresponding prompt.

In the third column (C), the functions are formed correctly and applied to the corresponding cells.
When the functions are applied, the actual outputs of these functions can be seen in this column.

To see the complete function as a text, there is the fourth column (D).

You can download and use the data set.
